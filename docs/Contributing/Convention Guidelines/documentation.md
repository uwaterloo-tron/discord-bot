## Adding a new cog

If you create a new cog, create a new markdown file in [docs/Commands/Cogs/][1]. The filename and header
should be identical to your cog's class name. In the markdown file, explain the function of the cog and
what each command does.

Add comments in your code explaining the use of any event listeners or tasks.

## Modifying a cog

Update the modified cog's markdown file as necessary.
