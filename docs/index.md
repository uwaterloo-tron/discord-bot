These cogs are comprised of
[commands](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/commands.html),
[tasks](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/tasks/index.html),
and
[event listeners](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#event-reference).


### Database

The bot uses a [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) database which can be accessed with
[pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html).
